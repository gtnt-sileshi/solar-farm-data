# Solar Farm Data Analysis Challenge

Welcome to the Solar Farm Data Analysis Challenge repository!

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to the challenge focusing on analyzing solar farm data from Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo. The challenge is designed to test skills in Data Engineering (DE), Financial Analytics (FA), and Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) as part of a selection process for a 12-week training program.

## Challenge Objective

The aim is to understand, explore, and analyze the solar farm data to generate meaningful insights. Participants should leverage analytical and machine learning techniques to evaluate the performance and impact of solar farms in the given countries.

## Challenge Details

- **Data Source**: Solar farm datasets from Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo.
- **Focus Areas**:
  - **Data Engineering (DE)**: Clean, transform, and prepare the data.
  - **Financial Analytics (FA)**: Assess financial performance and metrics.
  - **Machine Learning Engineering (MLE)**: Develop and apply models to derive insights and predictions.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gtnt-sileshi/solar-farm-data-analysis.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd solar-farm-data-analysis
   ```

3. **Set Up Your Environment**:
   Install the required dependencies using `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml`.

4. **Explore the Data**:
   The data is located in the `data` directory. Use these datasets to perform your analysis.

5. **Submit Your Work**:
   Compile your findings, including code, reports, and visualizations, and follow the submission instructions provided.
